# Polynomial Double Linked List Manager

This project is a simple coding project that utilizes a double linked list data structure to manage and display a polynomial. It provides functionalities to insert and delete terms in the polynomial based on their exponents.

## Features

- Insert Terms: The program offers an "Insert" menu that prompts the user to enter the coefficient and exponent of a term. The double linked list is then updated to include the new term in the appropriate position based on its exponent.
- Delete Terms: The "Delete" menu allows the user to remove a term from the polynomial based on its exponent. The double linked list is modified accordingly to reflect the updated polynomial.
- Display Polynomial: The program can display the polynomial in a user-friendly format, showing each term with its coefficient and exponent.

## Usage

1. Upon running the program, you will be presented with a menu.
2. Choose the "Insert" option and follow the prompts to enter the coefficient and exponent of a term.
3. The program will update the polynomial based on your input.
4. Choose the "Delete" option and enter the exponent of the term you wish to remove.
5. The program will update the polynomial by removing the term with the specified exponent.
7. Repeat steps 2-6 as desired.
8. Choose the "Exit" option to end the program.
